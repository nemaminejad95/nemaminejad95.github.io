Q3:
Data set name: Covid-19
[URL for the data set](https://github.com/datasets/covid-19)

why we need COVID-19 datasets: Even though COVID-19 sadly claimed the lives of over 400,000 Americans in just its first year, the next pandemic virus may be even more contagious and deadly. COVID-19 has harmed economies, jeopardized the growth of our kids, and endangered the future of our country. The fact that numerous scientists have long projected a pandemic that would claim tens of millions of deaths is even more concerning. Although it hasn't happened yet, it will eventually.

why we are interested in MetaData: The power of metadata on information can increase exponentially. It can be used to create logical models that explain how things work and can help us make a variety of crucial decisions. Humans intuitively tag, search for, and connect their experiences. It is a component of how we reason and think. Organizations are currently learning how to use software to accomplish much the same task. Digital transformation, knowledge-centric companies, next-generation industry models, pervasive machine learning, and other popular IT business leadership memes all rely wholly and fully on rich, searchable metadata layers. No matter what language you use, it's very obvious that there is motivation to treat the subject seriously.
